## Introducing Today's Project!

This project adds a discrete application feature to NextSound, a Node.js-based music streaming application. The system supports track browsing, music discovery, and UI state toggling between light and dark modes. The work focuses on extending existing application behavior without altering core platform assumptions.

### Key tools and concepts

The implementation uses a local IDE and Node.js as the runtime environment. Claude Code is used as an assisted development interface rather than an autonomous execution platform. Model selection is treated as a tradeoff between capability and cost, with higher-capability models reserved for complex logic generation and lower-cost models used for constrained tasks.

### Choosing the right AI model

I'm using Claude for this coding project. Other options include different Claude versions, each with varying processing power, cost, and capabilities. I'd choose a more powerful model for complex code or real-time processing, and a simpler one for cost-effectiveness and basic needs.

### Challenges and wins

The primary challenge was aligning generated code with the existing Node.js application structure and resolving integration errors introduced during iteration. The outcome was a functioning feature integrated into the application codebase. Follow-on work is scoped to recommendation logic but is not implemented in this project.

---

## Setting Up My Project

The development environment is prepared by cloning the existing NextSound codebase, installing the required Node.js runtime, and configuring Claude Code for assisted development. This setup ensures local parity with the application’s expected execution environment and establishes the tooling boundary for AI-assisted code generation.

### The Web App Code

Project dependencies are installed using npm to resolve all required libraries defined by the application. Dependency resolution is necessary to ensure predictable runtime behavior and compatibility with the existing codebase during development and testing.

### Claude Code

Claude Code is used as an interactive code assistance and planning tool integrated into the development workflow. It supports code generation and refinement but does not independently execute or deploy application logic. All generated output requires developer validation and integration.

## Managing Costs

### Why budget management matters

Cost controls are applied to prevent unbounded usage of AI model APIs. Since model usage is metered, cost limits act as a guardrail against unintended spend during iterative development.

### Using the /cost command

The /cost command provides estimated usage and spend visibility. This is used to evaluate the financial impact of development activity before expanding scope or increasing model utilization.

## Initializing Claude in My Project

Project initialization establishes the baseline context required for AI-assisted development. This includes ensuring dependencies are present, configuring Claude Code to operate against the existing repository, and defining constraints that guide how the tool interprets and generates code.

### The /init command

The /init command initializes Claude Code’s project context rather than provisioning infrastructure or executing application logic. It prepares configuration artifacts and working state so the tool can reason about the repository structure, dependencies, and expected development boundaries.

### CLAUDE.md

CLAUDE.md serves as a persistent, project-scoped context file consumed by Claude Code. It captures architectural intent, constraints, examples, and known issues to reduce ambiguity during assisted development. Unlike README.md, which targets human readers, this file exists to stabilize AI interactions and maintain consistency across sessions.

## Managing memory

### Updating memory via the terminal

Instructions are added through the Claude Code interface to influence subsequent code generation behavior. These instructions persist across interactions and affect how the tool interprets future requests.

### Claude manages different types of memory

Project memory stores implementation-specific context such as requirements and examples. User memory captures preferences and interaction patterns. Separation of memory types prevents cross-project contamination.

---

## Using Plan Mode

Plan mode is used to decompose a feature change into bounded implementation stages. The plan defines scope for basic sharing functionality, user experience enhancements, and advanced capabilities. This staged structure supports feasibility assessment, controlled delivery, and incremental validation rather than attempting a single-pass implementation.

### Understanding plan mode

Plan mode enforces an explicit execution order for complex tasks. It provides a mechanism to reason about dependencies, reduce cognitive load, and prevent scope creep during development. The mode does not implement features itself but constrains how work is sequenced and reviewed.

### Refining the plan to add stage controls

The plan is refined to introduce stage-level constraints and exit criteria. Adjustments focus on data flow, API usage patterns, and processing efficiency to reduce unnecessary calls and limit downstream impact. Refinement is used to align implementation decisions with system behavior rather than surface-level user experience.

## The Complete Feature

### The three-stage implementation

The feature is implemented in three bounded stages. The first stage establishes project structure and Node.js dependencies. The second stage introduces core application logic and UI behavior with AI-assisted code generation constrained to the existing architecture. The third stage validates behavior through targeted testing and limited performance observation rather than broad optimization claims.

### Benefits of staged development

Segmenting implementation into stages isolates risk and simplifies fault identification. Each stage addresses a distinct system concern, allowing verification before progressing. Testing is applied incrementally to confirm component behavior, integration compatibility, requirement alignment, and basic performance characteristics without assuming production equivalence.

### How much it costed to build this feature

Development costs remained within expected limits due to constrained AI usage and reduced API calls. Cost observations are limited to development-time activity and do not represent production operating expenses or long-term usage projections.

## Automating My Workflow

### Building custom commands

Slash commands wrap the three-stage workflow so each stage runs from a single command. Activate plan mode. Create a 3-stage plan: Requirements and Blueprint, Core Functionality, Refinement and Testing. Add strict stage controls with clear objectives, gatekeepers, and dependency management. Implement each stage one at a time, prioritizing, iterating within stages, and documenting.

### Use cases of commands

I could create custom commands to expand the app, such as automating tasks, personalizing experiences, and integrating external services.

## How I Used Commands

Personalized recommendation engine:

Stage 1: Data Collection and Profiling - Gather user data (purchase history, browsing activity, feedback) to create user profiles.

Stage 2: Algorithm Development and Model Training - Develop machine-learning algorithms to analyze data and train predictive models.

Stage 3: Integration and Testing - Integrate the engine, then test with real users.

### Workflow improvements

Automated tasks saved time, reduced errors, and enabled faster feature experimentation compared to manual planning. This streamlined the development process and improved workflow efficiency.
